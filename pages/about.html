  <h1>About Hamilton Tamil Sangam</h1>
  <p>
    Founded in May 2021, Hamilton Tamil Sangam (HTS) began as an intimate outdoor gathering of Tamil-speaking families. As our community grew, we expanded from small halls to larger community venues to accommodate our flourishing membership.
  </p>
  <p>
    HTS serves as a vital connection point for the Tamil community in the Hamilton area, Ontario. We create opportunities for families to meet, children to interact, and members to share experiences, fostering a strong sense of cultural unity and understanding.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2023, HTS achieved an important milestone by registering as a Non-Profit organization. Our mission is to actively promote, preserve, and celebrate the rich cultural and linguistic heritage of Tamil Nadu and its people.
  </p>
  <p>
    Operating independently of any religious or political affiliations, HTS is dedicated solely to enriching the social and cultural life of Hamilton's Tamil community, guided by our motto:

  <h3>"தமிழால் இணைவோம்! அறிவால் உயர்வோம்!"</h3>
